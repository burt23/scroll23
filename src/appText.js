  about:
    "Born in San Francisco in the late 80's, I've had a chance to see the technology in a unique light a the .com boom transformed my hometown into the technology hub of the world. During college, I studied economics during the worst downturn in modern history since the great depression, which afforded me insights into the struggles of the global economy and the possible vectors for survival. Returning to the tech roots that have always been around me I got back into coding fulltime in mid-2016, selling off my photography business and attending Hack Reactor. My current interests in tech revolve around creating more fair and just democratic systems, social justice and equality, cybersecurity and protecting our online identities, increasing energy efficiencies and reducing waste, more efficient modes of transportation, providing healthy food for our growing population, and space colonization.",
  music:
    "My true passion is music: Playing it, making it, and the act of performing and collaborating with other artists. Music my door into the 'zone', and is literally my way of sending good vibrations into the universe. Check out samples of my recordings, some are experimental using BOSS RC-30 and Loop Pedal. And if you want to jam!",
  testimonials:
    "A small sample of numerous 5-star reviews I received for the wedding shoots I did in San Francisco's beautiful and historic City Hall building, a popular location that features abundant natural light and stunning classic architecture.",
  weddings:
    "For the last 3 years, I've been working as a commercial photographer. I started two successful photography businesses, including SF City Hall Photo and a mobile photobooth business. I feel fortunate to get to share so many special moments with couples and families and help bring their beautiful memories to life with video and still shots. Currently booking weddings for 2018 and beyond, please reach out to me for availability and pricing details.",
